# Uber-Ride_Analysis_Dashboard_PowerBI

ðŸš€ My First Power BI Project â€“ Uber Ride Analysis
I recently completed my first Power BI project, where I analyzed an Uber ride dataset to explore patterns in ride behavior, usage trends, and purpose of travel.
ðŸ”Ž Using Power BI, I explored:
Business vs Personal ride share (Business trips ~70%)
Peak usage days (Thursdays & Fridays) and hours (morning & evening)
City-wise ride volumes (New York led with ~40% of all rides)
Common ride purposes (Meetings & customer visits made up over 50%)
Distance vs price relationships
This dashboard helped me turn raw data into actionable insights using interactive visuals, filters, and summary charts.
ðŸ’¬ I'm excited to share this as my first hands-on project in Power BI and would really appreciate your feedback or suggestions on how I can improve further.
Thanks for checking it out! ðŸ™Œ
